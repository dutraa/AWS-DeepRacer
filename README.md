# AWS-DeepRacer
AWS Deepracer organised by ANZ Melbourne collaborated with Amazon to have a run for the go!!!

In this repo i will go through all my tries, though i lasted in **10th Position among 30 participants** on **3rd-Feb-2020**


Though this wasn't exactly the competitions with the same parameters
* We cant change the **Actions** parameters
* We can't change the **Hyperparameters**
* We had a limited temporary AWS account which expires the next day after the workshop.

The Track used was of **[Re-Invent2018](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-deepracer-workshops/tree/master/Workshops/2018-reInvent/Lab1)**

# Conclusion
* **I went with the training time of 1 hour (Try 4) but it went downtracked for me, i should have submitted the models which at least ran 4hours - gave me best of 17.25 Seconds of round time**
* **Don't go with the reward graph and focus if you are completing the track 100%**
* **Don't clone the model, instead "Create a model" each time you need the clone a model.**
* **The guy who won ran it for almost 8 hours won the competition**
